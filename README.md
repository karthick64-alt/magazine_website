## Magazine Site

Modern Bootstrap 5-powered magazine site featuring curated news modules, responsive layouts, and dark mode support.

### Structure
- `index.html` – Homepage with featured carousel, latest news, categories, editor picks, multimedia, newsletter, and more.
- `category.html` – Category listing with filters and pagination controls.
- `article.html` – Single article view with share buttons, author bio, and comments.
- `about.html`, `contact.html`, `login.html` – Supporting pages for brand story, inquiries, and member access.
- `assets/css/style.css` – Custom theme enhancements layered on Bootstrap 5.
- `assets/js/main.js` – Ticker rotation, dark mode toggle, dynamic content helpers.
- `data/*.json` – Sample dataset for posts, categories, authors, and videos.

### Getting Started
1. Open `index.html` (or any page) in a modern browser.
2. Ensure the directory structure is preserved so relative asset paths resolve correctly.

### Customization
- Update colors, typography, and module spacing in `assets/css/style.css`.
- Add/edit sample content inside the JSON files within `data/`.
- Extend interactivity (carousel, filters, comment handling) through `assets/js/main.js`.
